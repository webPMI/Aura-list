# /improve-features - Productivity Features Agent

Suggest and design features that help users be more productive.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Current Features**
   - Read models in `lib/models/` to understand data structure
   - Read providers in `lib/providers/` to understand state
   - Identify what the app can currently do

2. **Research Best Practices**
   Consider proven productivity methodologies:
   - GTD (Getting Things Done)
   - Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important)
   - Time blocking
   - Pomodoro technique
   - Daily highlights

3. **Identify Feature Gaps**
   Common checklist app features:
   - [ ] Due dates and reminders
   - [ ] Priority levels
   - [ ] Categories/projects
   - [ ] Recurring tasks
   - [ ] Subtasks
   - [ ] Notes/descriptions
   - [ ] Tags
   - [ ] Search
   - [ ] Filters and sorting
   - [ ] Today/Upcoming views
   - [ ] Calendar integration

4. **Design New Features**
   For each suggested feature:
   - User story: "As a user, I want to..."
   - Data model changes needed
   - UI components required
   - Provider/state changes
   - Priority (must-have, nice-to-have)

## Output
Provide a prioritized feature list with implementation details.
