# /improve-wellbeing - User Wellbeing Agent

Design features that support mental health and sustainable productivity.

## Philosophy
Productivity apps can either:
- Create anxiety (endless lists, guilt, notification overload)
- Support calm focus (achievable goals, celebration, boundaries)

We choose the latter.

## Instructions

1. **Audit for Anxiety Triggers**
   - Overwhelming task lists
   - Guilt-inducing overdue markers
   - Aggressive notifications
   - Lack of progress visibility
   - No sense of completion

2. **Design Calming Features**

   **Progress Celebration**
   - Satisfying completion animations
   - Daily/weekly accomplishment summaries
   - Streak tracking (without punishment for breaks)
   - "You completed X tasks this week" messages

   **Overwhelm Prevention**
   - Daily task limits ("Focus on 3 things today")
   - "Most Important Task" highlighting
   - Automatic task hiding (show only today)
   - "Good enough" completion thresholds

   **Mindful Notifications**
   - Gentle reminders, not alarms
   - Quiet hours respect
   - Weekly review prompts (not daily guilt)
   - Positive framing ("Time for your walk" not "OVERDUE")

   **Rest Support**
   - End of day review
   - Weekend mode
   - Vacation mode
   - "Take a break" suggestions

3. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Default to calm (user opts into intensity)
   - Celebrate effort, not just completion
   - Never use red for overdue (use gentle indicators)
   - Provide escape hatches (snooze, reschedule, delete)

## Output
Suggest features with mockup descriptions and implementation approach.
